## What I do

Give rules and best practices on where to place files that are either imported via:

- Home Manager: `/home-manager`
- Normal: `/modules`

You do not need to manually import any file you place there, as they are automatically imported.
Therefore, it is important that you follow that rule.

## When to use me

When you want to create a file.
