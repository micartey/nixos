## Lenovo Hardware Controls

Lenovo can be shit - sadly my device is one of the "shitty" ones.
Lets see how the hinge holds up...

### Fan controls

```
# Silent mode
sudo su -c "echo 0 > /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:14.3/PNP0C09:00/VPC2004:00/fan_mode"

# Dust cleaning mode
sudo su -c "echo 1 > /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:14.3/PNP0C09:00/VPC2004:00/fan_mode"
```

### Battery controls

Enable this if your laptop should've been a desktop all along.

```
# Disable battery conservation (load to 100%)
sudo su -c "echo 0 > /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:14.3/PNP0C09:00/VPC2004:00/conservation_mode"

# Enable battery conservation (stop at 80%)
sudo su -c "echo 1 > /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:14.3/PNP0C09:00/VPC2004:00/conservation_mode"
```
